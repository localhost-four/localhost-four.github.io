Labmaze -
* This is a random level generator to complete.
The maze is generated by itself and builds new levels to complete.
(Based on your preferences)
You can pick up various items and use them to complete more difficult levels of difficulty!
Here you can find your appropriate level to complete, try similar levels and pass them.
Yeah, there's an artificial intelligence system that determines what the next level will be if you pass the previous one.

Also, there is a table of results for improving skills.

* The project itself was proposed by our neighbors living next door to us.
Using our knowledge in development, we implemented this idea.
listening to your opinion creates something new.

* This idea came to us by chance when it was known that some components of the game can interact with data and it was decided to develop their knowledge in this area. As a result, it turned out to be an automatic level adjustment system, now it looks much more interesting!
---
* Some parts of the project were taken from modifications, so I hope that when using them there will not be any difficulties in the future.
The data is not lost when you exit the game, but the game can break them.
Game is friendly with web browsers, so you can safely run.
